    <p class="about-text mx-auto">
        👋 Hi, I'm <strong>Amar Chadli</strong>, a passionate self-taught developer from <strong>Relizane, Algeria</strong>.
        <br /><br />
        I specialize in <strong>.NET Core</strong> and <strong>Blazor</strong>, and I love building meaningful, modern web applications.
        My journey started from curiosity and grew into a mission: to solve real-world problems through code.
        <br /><br />
        💡 I’m deeply involved in the Walkers Community and always looking to collaborate, learn, and contribute.
        Outside of coding, I enjoy night walks, EDM music, and tech gaming setups.
    </p>
